Generative Adversarial Network that learns to generate handwritten digits.

##GAN Superpowers - 
Here comes my favourite part about training GAN's. GAN's have two loss functions: one that encorages the generator to make better and better images and the other that encourages the discriminator to distinguish generated images form the real images.
Thus both the generator and the discriminator are being trained simultaneously. Now as the disciminator gets better and better at distinguishing the real images form the generated images, the generator is able to better tune its weights and biases to create more and more convincing images of handwritten text.
